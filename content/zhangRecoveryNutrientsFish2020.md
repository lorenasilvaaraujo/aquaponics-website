>## Abstract

The recovery of nutrients from residual Ô¨Åsh sludge in aquaponics could achieve zero solid waste discharge and supplement additional nutrients to hydroponics, thus yielding environmental and economic beneÔ¨Åts. In this study, novel biological aerated Ô¨Ålters (BAFs) with ceramsite plus different lignocellulosic materials (corn straw, wheat straw, and sawdust) are designed and installed in aquaponic systems. The BAFs performed the Ô¨Åsh sludge separation and nutrient conversion in a single equipment without the necessity for backwashing. The potential for nutrient recovery from Ô¨Åsh sludge is evaluated by comparing four BAFs Ô¨Ålled with different media. The BAF with ceramsite plus sawdust achieves the highest mineralization capacity based on nitriÔ¨Åcation and dissolved total phosphorus. The average concentrations of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and S macronutrients reach 12.3%, 11.8%, 4.5%, 26.4%, 22.6%, and 46.0% of those of Hoagland nutrient solution, respectively. The recovered Fe, Mn, and B micronutrients are 10.0%, 12.0%, and 18.0%, respectively, whereas Cu, Zn, and Mo are 1.5, 1.8, and 1.0 times, respectively, of those of Hoagland nutrient solution. The estimated nutrient recoveries of Ca, Mg, and S have good performance efÔ¨Åciencies, followed by K and Cu; those of N, P, Fe, Mn, and Zn have potentials for further improvement. The modiÔ¨Åed aquaponics with BAFs are proposed for the recovery of both dissolved and solid nutrients. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
