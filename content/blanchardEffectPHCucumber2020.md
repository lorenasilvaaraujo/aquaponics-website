>## Abstract

Decoupled aquaponic systems are gaining popularity as a way to manage water quality in aquaponic systems to suit plant and Ô¨Åsh growth independently. Aquaponic systems are known to be deÔ¨Åcient in several plant-essential elements, which can be aÔ¨Äected by solution pH to either increase or decrease available nutrients. To determine the eÔ¨Äect of pH in a decoupled aquaponic system, a study was conducted using aquaculture eÔ¨Ñuent from tilapia culture tanks at four pH treatments: 5.0, 5.8, 6.5, and 7.0, used to irrigate a cucumber crop. Growth and yield parameters, nutrient content of the irrigation water, and nutrients incorporated into the plant tissue were collected over two growing seasons. pH did not have a practical eÔ¨Äect on growth rate, internode length or yield over the two growing seasons. Availability and uptake of several nutrients were aÔ¨Äected by pH, but there was no overarching eÔ¨Äect that would necessitate its use in commercial systems. Nutrient concentrations in the aquaculture eÔ¨Ñuent would be considered low compared to hydroponic solutions; however, elemental analysis of leaf tissues was within the recommended ranges. Research into other nutrient sources provided by the system (i.e., solid particles carried with the irrigation water) would provide further information into the nutrient dynamics of this system.
