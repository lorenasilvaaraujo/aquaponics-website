>## Abstract

As the population of India increases, the most of the land occupied for constructions and industrial works for their comforts. Due to this, the agriculture land is decreasing that results less food production and cannot supply necessary food for the increased population. The people already experience this problem during COVID-19 pandemic. The vertical agriculture is ideal solution that introduced to ensure food security. In this form of soilless agriculture, we use controlling environment to monitor plant growth, to record pH and EC levels daily, to test for disease detections, to supply water with required nutrients and to check CO2 concentration. In this paper, we observed that plant intakes changing at various stages such as germination, vegetative, reproduction and maturity stages. We proposed enhanced and costeffective techniques for supplying all essentials of plants as much as they required according to their stage. We introduced two methods 1. To identify the vegetative stage based on plant height 2. To identify the reproduction stage using R-CNN algorithm. This helps to inform the farmer let to know the changes in plant stages in right time.
