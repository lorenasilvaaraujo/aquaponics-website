>## Abstract

Aquaponics is known to be one of the most efÔ¨Åcient agriculture production systems by far; however, limited quantitative data are available on the level of efÔ¨Åciency, particularly in comparison to its counterpart, hydroponics. This study compared aquaponics with hydroponics to assess nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) distributions, N- and P-use efÔ¨Åciency (NUE and PUE), and potential environmental impacts. Cherry tomato, basil, and lettuce were cultured in recirculating tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus)based aquaponic or stand-alone hydroponic systems over a 3-month period. N and P mass balances were developed by using N and P concentrations in Ô¨Åsh feed, solid waste, wastewater, Ô¨Åsh biomass, and plant biomass for aquaponic systems, and chemical fertilizer, wastewater, and plant biomass for hydroponic systems, which were to estimate N and P loss from each system via denitriÔ¨Åcation and P precipitations, respectively. In aquaponics, 59e70% of total N input was estimated to be lost via denitriÔ¨Åcation (45 e50%), wastewater (14e20%), and solid waste (0.7e2%) and 30e41% was assimilated into biomass (21 e24% Ô¨Åsh; 9e17% plants). In hydroponics, 76e87% was estimated to be lost via denitriÔ¨Åcation (69e78%) and wastewater (7e15%), and only 14e24% was assimilated into biomass. Similarly, 38e54% of total P input in aquaponics was lost via wastewater (22e28%), precipitations (8e25%), and solid waste (2e7%) and 46e62% was assimilated into biomass (35e45% Ô¨Åsh; 11e25% plants). In hydroponics, 79e89% of total P input was lost via wastewater (52e74%) and precipitations (15e27%), and only 11e21% was assimilated into plant biomass. Plant species had a signiÔ¨Åcant impact on N and P distribution, and tomato was most effective in removing N from wastewater and reducing denitriÔ¨Åcation via higher biomass production compared to basil and lettuce. NUE was lower for aquaponics than for hydroponics when only edible plant parts were taken into consideration, but 71e114% higher when both Ô¨Åsh and plant biomass were considered. Meanwhile, PUE was higher for aquaponics than for hydroponics even only when edible parts were considered and 336e369% higher when the biomass of both crops was considered. Our N and P mass balance analyses demonstrated for the Ô¨Årst time that aquaponics is more efÔ¨Åcient than hydroponics. Greater N and P losses in hydroponics were mainly due to higher N and P inputs, causing 2 times higher N loss via gas emission and up to 3 times higher P loss via inorganic P in wastewater compared to aquaponics. Therefore, reducing nutrient inputs is critical in improving NUE and PUE for both aquaponics and hydroponics, which should be combined with proper crop choice, operation conditions, and management practices to further improve the efÔ¨Åciency of the systems.
