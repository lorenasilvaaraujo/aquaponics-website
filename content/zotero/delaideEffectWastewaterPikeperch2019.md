>## Abstract

Decoupled aquaponic systems (DAPS) use the wastewater of recirculated aquaculture systems (RAS) as water source for plant production in recirculated hydroponic systems. RAS wastewater is complemented with macroand micronutrients to obtain equivalent concentrations and pH as in standard hydroponic nutrient solutions (NS). Unlike in single recirculating aquaponic systems, optimal growth conditions can be established in each production part of a DAPS (i.e. Ô¨Åsh and plant parts) avoiding compromises. DAPS design seems more adapted for commercial farming operations but feasibility studies on large-scale systems are lacking. Therefore, the production of tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L., cv. Foundation) grown in a NS based on complemented pikeperch RAS wastewater (i.e. AP treatment) has been compared to that of tomatoes grown in conventional hydroponic NS (i.e. HP treatment), in semi-practice conditions. During 3 consecutive years, tomatoes were grown on rockwool slabs, in a large-scale Venlo-type climate-controlled greenhouse, using a recirculated drip irrigation system identical to the ones used by the professionals of the hydroponic tomato sector.
