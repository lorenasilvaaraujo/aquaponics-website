>Grafting tomatoes with wild salinity resistant tomatoes can be done in an intermediate salinity level (suboptimal for both tomatoes and shrimp). It might also cause [[apical fruit rot]]. It is however a very good study, well executed and explained.

> [!info] Experiment data
>- Pacific white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) and tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L.) grafted to salinity tolerant wild tomatoes
>- [[Tomato]] was cultivated during 20 weeks (175 days) in a net house (80% mesh cover)
>- The four-levels factors were ecotype (three wild tomatoes plus the hybrid) and the [[salinity]] factor (2, 4, 6, and 9 g/L)
>- Sulfuric acid (H2SO4 at 1 meq/L) was added to adjust the pH to 6 for each treatment

>## Abstract

A vital goal of cleaner production involves developing agricultural production systems capable of ensuring sufÔ¨Åcient yields of highly necessary foods to meet the increasing needs of the global population while minimizing the associated economic and ecological costs. Integrated agri-aquaculture systems (IAAS) offer a number of advantages for sustainable agriculture, including water reutilization, discharge mitigation, and increased proÔ¨Åtability by leveraging the symbiotic relationship between organic waste, bacterial mineralization, and plant Ô¨Åltration. The aim of this study was to assess the production of two food items of global socio-economic importance cultivated at different salinities: PaciÔ¨Åc white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) and tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L.) grafted to salinity tolerant wild tomatoes. PaciÔ¨Åc white shrimp were cultured at a density of 125 organisms/m3 and tomatoes at a density of 3 plants/m. The shrimp growth test consisted of three salinity levels: 2, 4, and 6 g/L. The corresponding tomato salinity treatments were conducted using shrimp water efÔ¨Çuents; Steiner‚Äôs universal nutrient solution (SNS) was used for the control treatment. The experimental period lasted 175 days. The highest tomato production (77.46 t/ha) was attained with SNS, with no signiÔ¨Åcant difference from the salinity of 2 g/L. Shrimp Ô¨Ånal mean weight, survival, and production were higher at the 6 g/L salinity; and all the other zootechnical parameters decreased with lower salinity. When compared with the hydroponic system using a cost-beneÔ¨Åt analysis (CBA), the production costs associated with the IAAS were lower primarily because of the reduced (or null) costs of fertilizer, and irrigation water. When grafted plants were used, the salinity tolerance of the commercial hybrid increased and shrimp could be cultured at appropriate salinity to facilitate osmoregulation. Chemical fertilization requirements were reduced and acceptable yields were obtained for the tomato crop by grafting to salinity-tolerant rootstocks.
