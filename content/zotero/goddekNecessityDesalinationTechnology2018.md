>## Abstract

Providing both Ô¨Åsh and plants with optimal environmental conditions is a classical problem in the Ô¨Åeld of aquaponics. Several studies have tackled this problem by decoupling Ô¨Åsh and plant systems. However, in order to achieve both high nutrient levels for the plants and low nutrient and particulate loading in the Ô¨Åsh tanks, suspended matter in the aquaculture component needs to be discharged and fertilizer needs to be added to the plants continuously. The present study aims to explore to what degree desalination technology could potentially be used to provide the necessary balance between the two diÔ¨Äerent components based on a theoretical modelling approach using contemporary source material. We suggest how speciÔ¨Åc desalination engineering approaches can improve the nutrient balances in multi-loop aquaponics systems in order to attain optimal growth conditions for both Ô¨Åsh and plants.
