>## Abstract

Aquaponic is a relatively new system of farming, which has received much research attention due to its potential for sustainability. However, there is no consensus on comparability between crop yields obtained from aquaponics (AP) and conventional hydroponics (cHP). Meta-analysis was used to synthesize the literature on studies that compared crop yields of AP and cHP. Factors responsible for diÔ¨Äerences were also examined through subgroup analysis. A literature search was conducted in Ô¨Åve databases with no time restriction in order to capture any publication on AP and cHP crop yield comparisons. The search was, however, limited to journal and conference articles published in English. Study characteristics and outcome measures of food crops were extracted. A natural log response ratio eÔ¨Äect size measure was used to transform study outcomes. An unweighted meta-analysis was conducted through bootstrapping to calculate overall eÔ¨Äect size and its conÔ¨Ådence interval. Between-study heterogeneity (I2) was estimated using a random eÔ¨Äects model. Subgroup and meta-regression were used to assess moderators, in an attempt to explain heterogeneity in the eÔ¨Äect size. The results showed that although crop yield in AP was lower than conventional cHP, the diÔ¨Äerence was not statistically signiÔ¨Åcant. However, drawing conclusions on the overall eÔ¨Äect size must be done with caution due to the use of unweighted meta-analysis. There were statistically signiÔ¨Åcant eÔ¨Äects of aquatic organism, hydroponic system type, and nutrient supplementation used in the studies on crop yield comparisons. Nutrient supplementation, particularly, led to on average higher crop yield in AP relative to cHP. These Ô¨Åndings are a vital information source for choosing factors to include in an AP study. These Ô¨Åndings also synthesize the current trends in AP crop yields in comparison with cHP.
