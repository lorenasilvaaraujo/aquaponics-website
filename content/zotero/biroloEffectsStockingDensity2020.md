>## Abstract

In the present study, we evaluated the eÔ¨Äects of two stocking densities (low - ALD, 3.81 kg m‚àí3 vs. high - AHD, 7.26 kg m‚àí3) on the growth, health, and Ô¨Çesh quality of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and the yield and microbiological quality of lettuce (Lactuca sativa) produced in a low-tech aquaponic system compared to hydroponic cultivation (HYP). Nine experimental units (three replications per treatment) were utilised. A total of 123 rainbow trout (initial body weight: 142 ¬± 35 g) were randomly distributed in six 500-L tanks (3 per stocking density) and monitored during a 117 day trial period. The Ô¨Ånal weight (331 g on average), speciÔ¨Åc growth rate (0.73% d‚àí1), feed conversion ratio (1.58), and mortality (3%) of the Ô¨Åsh did not diÔ¨Äer between stocking densities. The morphometric indices, slaughter results, and Ô¨Çesh quality were not aÔ¨Äected. Similarly, the quantity of lettuce produced during two consecutive cycles was similar among treatments (2.4 kg m‚àí2 on average). At harvest, microbial contamination (total viable count, E. coli, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas, mould, and yeasts) was similar in the Ô¨Åsh skin and lettuce produced in aquaponic systems with diÔ¨Äerent stocking densities, as well as in the lettuce produced in aquaponic and hydroponic systems. In conclusion, rainbow trout and lettuce productions were successful in the tested aquaponic system, whereas stocking density did not aÔ¨Äect Ô¨Åsh growth or Ô¨Çesh quality.
