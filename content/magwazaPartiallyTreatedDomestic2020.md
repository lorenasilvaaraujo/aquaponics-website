>## Abstract

Using efÔ¨Çuent from the anaerobic bafÔ¨Çed reactor (ABR) of the decentralised wastewater treatment system (DEWATS) as a sole nutrient source is not sufÔ¨Åcient for tomato plants grown in hydroponic system. The study investigated the effects of commercial hydroponic fertilizer mix (CHFM) combined with ABR efÔ¨Çuent on tomato growth and yield. A media-based hydroponic technique consisting of three treatments, namely, ABR efÔ¨Çuent, CHFM, and ABR efÔ¨Çuent combined with CHFM (ABR √æ CHFM (50:50 v/v) was used. The results showed that plant growth parameters, biomass, fruit yield and shoot nutrient content were signiÔ¨Åcantly higher in tomato plants fed with CHFM and ABR √æ CHFM than those grown in ABR efÔ¨Çuent. Addition of 50 % dose of CHFM in ABR wastewater (ABR √æ CHFM) increased shoot N, K, Ca and Zn. These results indicated that adding 50% CHFM can alleviate nutrient deÔ¨Åciencies when partially treated wastewater from anaerobic digester is used as a nutrient source for hydroponic tomato cultivation.
