>## Abstract

Aquaponics is the integration of aquaculture and hydroponic systems where, in general terms, the waste produced by aquatic organisms becomes nutrients through bacterial action for plant growth. Water consumption as well as the environmental impact in this type of system are lower compared to more traditional hydroponic and aquaculture counterparts, due to its dual productive nature and closed condition of the system allowing the reuse of water and fish waste. The present study evaluated the yield, nitrate concentration, microbiological and functional quality of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) grown in two production systems: aquaponics and hydroponics. At the same time, fresh mass gain and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were assessed. Lettuces were grown in an aquaponic system using waste water from the fish system, as well as in a hydroponic system with nutrient solution (Hoagland II-modified) both for 21 days. At the end of this period, baby lettuce (8 and 12 cm of length) was harvested. The yield of lettuce grown in aquaponic system was 6.73% higher than that of grown in hydroponic system. Also aquaponically grown lettuce had lower nitrate concentration (1079 mg kg-1 FW) than hydroponically grown lettuce (1229 mg kg-1 FW). Lettuces grown in both systems showed no significant differences in the microbial and functional qualities. Rainbow trout in the aquaponic system increased 13.6 g over 27.1±0.8 g initial fresh weight, obtaining a FCR of 0.74 after the experiment. These results indicate that the aquaponic system used in the present study is a sustainable alternative for the production of high quality lettuce considering its high yield, lower concentration of nitrates and similar microbiological and functional qualities compared to hydroponic systems, while allowing simultaneous fish farming with a good feed conversion ratio (74 g of food was needed to produce 100 g of rainbow trout).

## Yield
 #todo Pantanella et al. (2012). These authors obtained 2.71 kg m-2 after 21 days from transplant using ‘Roman’ lettuce (20 plants m-2) grown on floating root and Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L.) in high density with 8 kg fish m-3. 
 #todo Lennard and Leonard (2006) harvested 4.47±0.12 kg m-2 of ‘Oak’ leaf lettuce (40 plants m-2) in root floating technique using waste of 5 kg of Murray cod m-3. #todo Licamele (2009) obtained yields of 4.7 kg m-2 in ‘Rex’ lettuce (32 plants m-2) after 35 days with Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L.) with a density of 5 kg fish m-3. 
 #todo The highest yield described in these studies could be due to Nile tilapia and Murray cod being maintained at 20 to 25°C, the optimal range for these fish and also for nitrifying bacteria and lettuce growth (FAO, 2014).” ([Alcarraz et al., 2018, p. 33](zotero://select/library/items/2J8AIQBB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EZ449CIN?page=3&annotation=UMDM7NL8))

## Nitrate Concentration
The nitrate concentration in lettuce cultivated in our aquaponics system was greater than the results obtained
#todo Blidariu et al. (2013). These authors found 810 mg kg-1 fw in Spanish lettuce cultivated with residues of pikeperch (Sander lucioperca). 
#todo Lastra et al. (2009) for the cultivars ‘Grand Rapids’, ‘Breeze’, ‘Divine’ and ‘Prima’. The higher nitrates concentration found in hydroponic lettuce in the present study could be explained due to the greater availability of nitrate in the nutrient solution at the beginning of the experiment (150 mg L-1). While for the lettuce in the aquaponic system the average concentration of nitrate was 14.9 mg L-1.” ([Alcarraz et al., 2018, p. 34](zotero://select/library/items/2J8AIQBB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EZ449CIN?page=4&annotation=J4EDBCXQ))


## Mesophilic Aerobic Bacteria counts (MAB)
#todo Sirsat and Neal (2013) with 3.2 log CFU g-1 for ‘Romaine’ lettuce cultivated in aquaponics under a greenhouse. 
#todo Scuderi et al. (2011) reported counts of 6.0 log CFU g-1 for lettuce grown in a hydroponic floating root system. Enterobacteriaceae count was less than 2.3 log CFU g-1 reported by Scuderi et al. (2011) in a similar study. The psychrophilic bacteria count was lower than the value reported by 
#todo Orellana (2011), who found 4.9 log CFU g-1 in rocket leaves grown in hydroponic system. [Alcarraz et al., 2018, p. 34](zotero://select/library/items/2J8AIQBB)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EZ449CIN?page=4&annotation=FDFEUDVG))

## Feed Conversion Rate
Lennard	 and	 Leonard	 (2006)	 and	 Palm	 et	 al.	 (2014)	obtained	in	aquaponics	systems	FCR	between	0.85	to	0.93	for	 Murray	 cod	 (Maccullochella	peelii)	 and	 Nile	 tilapia	 (Oreochromis	niloticus),	respectively.	FCR	depends	of	 the	 quality	 and	 amount	 of	 food	 and	 water	 quality	 used	 during	 culture	 (Palm	 et	 al.,	 2014).

## Functional Compound
Total	phenol	contents	registered	in	 this	experiment	were	higher	compared	to	those	reported	by	Llorach	 et	 al.	 (2008).	 These	 authors	 found	 18.2,	 63.5	 and	 125.5	 mg	 GAE	 100	 g-1	 fw	 for	 ‘Iceberg’,	 ‘Romaine’	 and	 ‘Continental’	 lettuces,	 respectively.	 However,	 the	 total	 phenol	 content	 was	 similar	 to	 those	 found	in	Spanish	lettuce	(164	mg	GAE	100	g-1	fw)	and	lower	than	‘Red	Oak	leaf’	(322	mg	 GAE	100	g-1	fw)	and	‘Lollo	Rosso’	(571	mg	GAE	100	g-1	fw)	(Llorach	et	al.,	2008).
